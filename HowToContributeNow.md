# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE NOW (IN 3 SIMPLE STEPS)

### WARNING:
Below you will see the 3 simple steps on how to contribute. But before we suggest to download the free demo version of the philosophical-quiz-board-game (no registration required) in our website (https://championsrenaissance.com/shop/). You also can see the two video tutorials in YouTube to learn how to play in (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjSXRls4qmi2DdgbDb9iaA). We also suggest to read the Champion's Renaissance book. (It contain the long answers of the 94 questions). You can read for free an extract of the book in the website as well (https://championsrenaissance.com/book-extract-with-no-registration/). We also encourage to read the King Neo New Renaissance Movement page to discover more about its values and motivation (https://championsrenaissance.com/king-neo-new-renaissance-movement/) and the GitHub Open-Source Projects page (https://championsrenaissance.com/github-open-source-projects/). 

## INTRODUCTION

After this introduction read below a 3 STEP guide on how to contribute. 
The first thing you need to understand is that each video is made of two parts.

#### START AND END WITH AN ANIMATION LOGO (Under CC BY-ND license)
Each video starts with a short 7 seconds animation and it ends with the same. It is called "AnimationLogoStartAndEnd". This animated logo cannot be changed because it is under the CC BY-ND license. At the moment of the edition downloadit from YouTube and use it as it is. You will put it at the beginning and at the end of each video. You can find it in our YouTube Channel here.  ([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjSXRls4qmi2DdgbDb9ia](https://youtu.be/a_y764Gqn8E)A). 

#### THE FIRST PART OF EACH VIDEO
Let us begin explaining the first part. The first part of the video is a short part (near 10% of its length). It contains the text of one question and answer. (The contributor can choose one of the 94 questions and answers from the "94QuestionsAndAnswersText" document in the main). The number, question and answer must be shown in the video in text and/or with voice. The text cannot be changed because the questions and answers are under the CC BY-ND license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode). This license lets others reuse the work for any purpose, including commercially; however, it cannot be shared with others in adapted form (no changes allowed) and credit must be provided to the original. But images can be added in connection to the original text. The reasonable attribution required for the videos is to mention the philosophic-quiz-game in them and provide a link to download it. (See the "ExampleVideoTextCreation" document in the main). That is all you need to know about the first part of each video. Now let us explain the second part of it.

#### THE SECOND PART OF EACH VIDEO
In the second part of each video (around 90% of its lenght), you can add more text for a better explanation of the question and answer, that is, text to enrich its understanding and scope. Creators can write about some paticular aspect to enhance the question and answer, for example, from a historic, scientific, politic, atistic or other point of view. The text of the second part of the video can also be a short story for an animated (5 to 10 minutes) short-film, similar tot the Oscar's category films. Invent a story is another way to explain the question and answer of your choice. Whatever the case, we suggest to read the long answers of the questions in the Champion's Renaissance book for a better understanding of the context. We also suggest to make a simple story-board for the whole video. You must write (text between parenthesis) the desciptions of the images, animations, sounds and music. This second part of each video is under the CC BY-SA license. (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode). This license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit the original (in this case to mention the philosophic-quiz-game and a link to download it) and you and license your new creation under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.

# 3 STEPS TO MAKE A VIDEO


## STEP 1: Build the TEXT-FORMAT (text in two parts):

#### TEXT PART 1 (CC BY-ND license)
1.	In the main, open the "94QuestionsAndAnswersText" document.
2.	Choose one of the 94 questions for the text of your video (copy the whole text with its number).
3.	Open the "TEXT-FORMAT" document in the main. Paste the text of the question and answer at the top, under the title “PART 1”. (Write between parenthesis the description of the images and audios you would like to connect them to. Be sure to follow the luxury-aesthetic-conditions of this license (read the "LuxuryAestethicConditions" documents in the main)).
4.	Next, paste the "attribution text" of your choice. Choose one text from the "AttributionTextOptions" document in the main. Choose, copy and paste one of the text options below "PART 1" in the "TEXT-FORMAT" document of the main. After pasting the text of the question and answer with its number, write (between parenthesis) the description of the images and audios you want to connect them to. Remember to follow the luxury-aesthetic-conditions described in the "LuxuryAestheticConditions" document in the main. This luxury-aesthetic-conditions document is part of this license. 

#### TEXT PART 2 (CC BY-SA license plus luxury-aesthetic-conditions)
1.	Create your own text for a better explanation of the text of part 1. Choose the text you like. It can be a didactic educational animation, or an audio-visual abstract using shapes explanation, or a story of a short film with animated characters. Whatever your choice, be sure it is connected to the text of part 1 and enhance the explanation. We suggest to read the long answer in the book to expand your knowledge of the answer. (After you have the text of the 2nd part of the video, one more time, write between parenthesis the description of the images and audios you want to connect them to and, again, be sure to follow the luxury-aesthetic-conditions).
2.	Write the text of your attribution (your name or company) and repeat the attribution you choose for part 1. (See the "ExampleVideoFormatText" document in the main).

#### SAVE TEXT OF PART 1 AND 2
Once you have ended all the text using the format, save it as an .md document. Name it as follows. First, identify the number of the question text. For example, if your video is about question number 1, use (q_1_text). Then, add a name for your video, for example (MindMolds). If your name is John and your last name Doe, add it at the end. In this example, the complete name of your document containing the text of your video would be (q_1_text_MindMolds_JohnDoe.md). Be sure to save and store the .md document containing the text of your video in the proper folder. The “q_1” folder contains texts for question number 1; the “q_2” folder contains texts for question number 2 and so forth. Find the folders of the numbered questions inside the "TextFormatsArchive" folder of the main.

## STEP 2: Create your visual and audio material

1.	Create your own audio or visual creations, or be sure not to use others under copyright. Be sure to follow the luxury-aesthetic-conditions (read the "LuxuryAestethicsConditions" document in the main).
2.	Identify each document with (a) the number of the question, (b) the name to the file and (c) your name (in the following examples, your name will be John and lastname Doe). For images use, for example: “q_1_WhiteRose_JohnDoe.png” or “q_1_SailboatSailingDroneView_JohnDoe.jpge”. For music: “q_1_BachOperture_JohnDoe.mp3”. For sound: “q_1_BigBenBell_JohnDoe.mp3”. For animations: q_1_PyramidAllegoryAnimation_JohnDoe.blend in case for a Blender animation. Follow the same criteria with other format files or extensions.
3.  Store the document in the proper folder in the main. Folders of images, animations, draws, blender, etc., don't contain sub-folders.

## STEP 3: Edit, upload the video to YouTube and store it when ready
Edit your video in a video editor of your preference. (See instructions in the "EDITION" document in the main of the repository). After you end the edition, upload the video to YouTube. In the YouTube channel, when you upload the video, be sure that the "visibility" is not "public" yet. At the begining check it as "unlisted"). Then, make a pull request in GitHub sending the link of your "unlisted" video you have uploaded to YouTube. The maintainers of our GitHub repository will see it to make observations. Make changes if maintainers requires to. Repeat the process untill the video is approved. Then upload the video to YouTube and change its visibility status to "public". After that, pull a new request to save and store the link of your final video in the "ListOfApprovedVideos" folder in the main. To save and store your video name it as follows. For example, if the video is about question number one, use (Q-1) at the beginning of the name, then, the name you choose for it, for instance (MindMolds) and, at the end, your name (JohnDoe). So, if you choose "Mind Molds" as the name of your video (in relation to question number one), the whole name of your video will be: "Q-1_MindMolds_JohnDoe.mp4". (Put the YouTube link at its side between parenthesis, so any contributor can click it and see it in YouTube). 

#### (Videos must be between 1 to 5 minutes. Videos from 5 to 10 minutes are short-stories for short-films, similar to that category in the Oscars).
#### VIDEOS WILL BE RANKED
