# ExceptionalMindGame (under construction)
Here we create artistic images and connect them to the TEXT of 94 questions and answers of a philosophical game and its book of answers to produce videos for YouTube (and other things). The TEXT of the questions and answers are Charles Kocian copyright © creations. This TEXT is the “licensed material” under the CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NODERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC LICENSE. Any arts can be created in the videos, such as background images, animations or similar to support the TEXT of the 94 questions and answers, but the TEXT itself cannot be changed. We invite contributors to create their own video version for a question and answer. The TEXT of the 94 questions and answers (and the template) is in the "main" branch of the repository. Fork it and create your own version of a video for YouTube. Discover more and how to do it in the King Neo New Renaissance Movement website link.
Introduction
Welcome to the King Neo GitHub Open-Source Project community. Our purpose is to create videos for YouTube based in the 94 question and answers of the Exceptional Mind game and its book of answers Champion’s Renaissance. Copyright by Charles Kocian. The videos are produced using the ExceptionalMindGame GitHub repository where contributors can fork the main to begin to create their own creations. This is a long text that explains everything. It includes a short explanation, a long one and some other issues at the end, including the code of conduct and the list of the 94 questions and answers.
