# ExceptionalMindGame
Welcome! To start contributing read the "HowToContributeNow" document in the main. In this repository we use the best "explainer-video-software" to explain one question and answer (one per video) of the 94 questions and answers of a philosophic-quiz-game (called Exceptional Mind and its book of answers, called Champion's Renaissance, both created by the architect and writer Charles Kocian. Se examples in our YouTube Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjSXRls4qmi2DdgbDb9iaA). We invite programmers, artists, painters, designers, architects, musicians, video editors and similar persons to create the best "explainer-videos" using software as Powtoon, Wideo, Animaker, Biteable, Lumen5, RawShorts, VideoScribe, MySimpleShow, Moovly, Ease Sketch Pro, Clipchamp, Davinci Resolve, Blender, Godot and similars. Each video has between 2 to 5 minutes length, or 5 to 10 minutes lenght in case of an animation short film category of the Oscars). Each video has two parts. The first part (under CC-BY-ND license) is to copy the text of one question and answer. The second part (under CC-BY-SA license) is a free creation with a luxury aesthetic standard to expand the answer of the question. See more in the "HowToContributeNow" and "License" documents. The videos will be publicly ranked (or voted) to know which are the best ones. (Perhaps a contest and prize can exist in the future if we find sponsors for this). The game, this repository and its community is the heart of the King Neo New Renaissance Movement, which feat is to ease human species evolution to excellence perfecting the morality of reason. Discover its values in https://championsrenaissance.com/king-neo-new-renaissance-movement/) page website. The best way to begin to contribute here is to familiarize with the philosophic-quiz-game. For that, we suggest to download the free demo in our website shop page (https://championsrenaissance.com/shop/) and see the two video tutorials in our YouTube channel to learn how to play.
