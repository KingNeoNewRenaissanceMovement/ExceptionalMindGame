### WHAT DO WE DO
In this repository we use the best "explainer-video-software" to explain one question and answer (one per video) of the 94 questions and answers of a philosophic-quiz-game called Exceptional Mind and its book of answers, called Champion's Renaissance, both created by the architect and writer Charles Kocian. See examples and the tutorial of the game in our YouTube Channel. (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjSXRls4qmi2DdgbDb9iaA). 

### VIDEO CHARACTERSITICS
Each video has two parts. The first part (under CC-BY-ND license) is done copying the text of one question and answer. The second part (under CC-BY-SA license) is a free creation to enhance the answer of the question. Each video has between 2 to 5 minutes length, or 5 to 10 minutes lenght in case of an animation short film category, similar of the Oscars of that category.
