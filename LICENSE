GitHub King Neo New Renaissance Movement 
Readme
In this community we create artistic images and connect them to the TEXT of 94 questions and answers of a philosophical game and its book of answers to produce videos for YouTube (and other things). The TEXT of the questions and answers are Charles Kocian copyright © creations. This TEXT is the “licensed material” under the CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NODERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC LICENSE. Any arts can be created in the videos, as background or similar to support the TEXT of the 94 questions and answers, but the TEXT itself cannot be changed. Create your video version using the same TEXT for a question and answer. The TEXT of the 94 questions and answers and the story-board-template is the "main" branch data of the repository. Anyone can fork the story-board-template and choose a question/answer to create its own version of an artistic video for YouTube. Discover more and how to do it in the website link.

Introduction
What follows is the reasonable manner and conditions to use the Creative Commons license mentioned above. To be crystal clear, a license is a simple agreement or contract between two reasonable persons, who act in good faith to agree their wills regards to the thing and the price. The two reasonable persons here are: “the licensor” (Charles Kocian as the author of the “license material”), who makes a contract with “the licensee”, (the person who is going to use the “license material” to make its own artistic creations). In this case the thing, is the “license material”. It is the text of 94 philosophical questions and its 94 short answers. The short answers are part of a book called Champion’s Renaissance and the philosophical questions are the questions of a game called Exceptional Mind. The book acts as the answers book of the questions of the game. This two works where (fictionally) created by the characters of Charles Kocian novel called One Exceptional Mind. The author of all this artistic works is Charles Kocian and, although they are the context of the “license material”, they are not the “license material” itself, therefore, are not under this CC BY-ND license. All rights of the novel, book and game are reserved to Charles Kocian under copyright © international laws. Only the text of the questions and answers are under the CC BY-ND public license.
Being the novel, book and game the greater context of the “license material”, we strongly recommend “the licensees” to create their art works after reading them and playing the game, to understand the context and avoid producing “adapted material”, something that is prohibited by this license, (read it below), accordingly to Section 1.a.
About the license material
The “license material” (the text sentences of the numbered questions of the game and the numbered short answers of the book described in the list below), as it was said, are under the Copyright © and Similar Rights held by “the licensor”. To comply this license, “the licensee” must assure the following. First, he needs to maintain the “license material” unchanged, that is, the texts of the sentences of the questions and answers of the game cannot be adapted, change, altered, arranged, transformed, or modified without “the licensor” permission. These sentences of questions and answers as presented below are the prime matter that “the licensee” will use to its own creations. Second, “the licensee” is allowed to add images in connection to the text. (This accordingly of what says in https://certificates.creativecommons.org, in 2. Adaptations 5. It says that, “as a legal matter, at times it is tricky to determine exactly what is and is not an adaptation”, but then recommend some rules about the licenses to keep in mind, saying that, “including an image in connection with text, as in a blog post, a powerpoint, or an article, does not create an adaptation unless the photo itself is adapted”). In this case, the “licence material” is only text, therefore, any kind of image or other mean except text can be connected to it, and that action will not produce “adapted material”. So, we encourage “the licensee” to create pictures, paintings, draws, videos and animations, including sounds, voice, music and other forms of art or interactions, and connect them to the text of the “licence material” to produce videos for YouTube. They are allowed to do this but with three conditions. 
Firstly, (and the fundamental one), is to connect the text of the 94 questions and answers with their creations to produce videos for YouTube to enhance, refine and enrich its intellectual understanding and spread.  The “licensees” creators must act with high quality standards of production and aesthetic requirements used in the luxury industry. They will use Cinzel and Cormorant fonts, dark purple backgrounds, gold and silver colours, including light grey, black and white backgrounds too, in a similar style of the championsrenaissance website and the game aesthetics. (Download free DEMO version to see it. As aesthetic references for our production of the videos for YouTube are the luxury aesthetic standards used by high quality companies such as Rolls-Royce or Rolex. The aesthetics they use in their videos, pictures and websites for their advertising campaigns guide and inspire us. Other aesthetic reference we are inspire with is the art of the Renaissance, especially the works of Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci and Rafael and also the works of Ancient Athens and their works such as the Parthenon. The music aesthetics references to use in these videos are Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Rachmaninov and similar; modern slow electronic and fashion show music or light jazz, but not sad music. They must be happy, that is, allegro or andante. Discotheque music, heavy metal, hard rock, reggaeton and the like are not allowed. Any type of songs with text, choirs or soloists, including opera is not allowed. The sounds used also must enhance the understanding of the questions and answers and, especially, the final edition of the video as well. The golden number and Fibonacci sequence are welcomed in visual designs. We encourage to create art works derived from natural patterns, abstract or not, that may include natural landscapes like mountains, stars, clouds, waves and sea. We view art as beauty, and we agree that beauty exist in nature’s order. The videos must contain only one question and answer at a time. Each video in total will be between 30 seconds to 5 minutes accordingly to a Format sequence described below. All other type of creations that are not videos for YouTube can be done, but they are not the first priority of our community. They are in second place and, in case they are done, they must be done with the condition that they will follow the same criteria as those for the videos for YouTube. For instance, the text of one question and answers of the 94 questions and answers can be used in T- shirts, cups, posters, pictures memes to be spread in social media, illuminated signs, artistic painting and photograph. In case of a painter or photographer artist’s book, they can use the text of all the questions and answers to produce a high-quality paper luxury book. In that case they will use the text of one question and answer at a time, in one or more pages, but never more than one per page to not confuse the public. Group of different artists can make collective works, for instance, one producing music, other draws, paintings or artistic photographs. Other example is a collective production of one video, for instance, with one programmer using Blender to create 3D virtual shapes; other programmer using Godot to create an animation to explain the question and answer and another programmer who use Davinci Resolve to edit the final video for YouTube. Other example can be as different artists showing their individual creations in high-end art galleries, through collective expositions, where they can show their individual works to produce a collection of paintings and photographs, each with one question and answer created by different artist. A coordinated effort of artist gives them a bigger media coverage and allow them to attract the interest of high-end art galleries and sponsors of luxury brands, such as Benetau Yatchs, Airbus Helicopters, Rolls-Royce, Rolex or Parker. This allows them to resonate with high standards, such of Versailles, Windsor Castle or the Louvre and British Museum. Also with the highest universities, such as Tsinghua University, University of Delhi, Cambridge, Oxford, Le Sorbonne, Harvard or MIT and other top-level institutions such as Moscow State University, University of Cape Town, University of Tehran, King AbdulAziz University, University of São Paulo and others best universities and institutions in all continents of the world).
The second condition for the “licensees” is to produce these videos for YouTube, to advertise the Exceptional Mind game and the Champion’s Renaissance book, (the book that contains the full answers of the 94 questions of the game). The purpose of this advertisement in the videos is to increase the sales of the book and game. This request of the “licensor” is proper and accordingly to the attribution required for this license, that says in Section 3.a.1.A.i (Licence Conditions and Attributions) that “the licensee” or user of this license needs to identify the author of the “licensed material”, in this case Charles Kocian as the “licensor” or creator of the game and book. The text of this license says that “the licensor” can request to receive attribution in a reasonable manner. His request to receive attribution through the advertising of the game and its book to increase its sales is a reasonable manner for the following reasons. Firstly, because the sale of the game and its book supports him economically to continue doing its work of writing future books and leading the movement. Secondly, because the better the sales the more people will be playing the game and reading the book, and that will allow them to become exceptional minds and achieve their personal eudaimonia. (Eudaimonia is the holistic highest happiness possible for a virtuous man, being a virtuous man a virtuous-rational-animal who decided to practice the morality of reason to achieve its greater wealth in every sense, a deep happiness derived from the Aristotelian-telos-fulfilment as it is explained in the book. The objective of the book, game and novel is to help people to achieve eudaimonia). Thirdly, because the more people become exceptional minds and achieve eudaimonia, the smarter the world will be in the current and future generations. This is why Charles Kocian created the King Neo New Renaissance Movement, whose vision is to ease human species evolution to excellence perfecting the morality of reason. The “licensees”, by doing their creations, will contribute to implement the vision’s movement, that is, to make it a material practical reality. If the Renaissance happened, a New Renaissance also can happen, and we are going to make it happen. These are enough reasons that allow “the licensor” to request attribution in the manner he is asking for. It is a win-win reasonable deal that benefit a smarter humanity and create not a future idiocracy, but a future smartcracy. To fulfil the licensor request in this manner, “the licensees” contributors will include in their videos, images of the book and game as they exist in the championsrenaissance website, without changing its colours images or fonts. They are required to include a URL or hyperlink in a relevant place of their videos to grab people's attention, so they can click through and go to a sales page on the championsrenaissance website where the book and game are sold. (In case of other type of creations that are not videos, like paper artistic books, collections of photographs (or paintings) in expositions of art galleries, those works or events must clearly explain to the users where to buy the book and game. WARNING: The “license material” cannot be used as parts or inserts of other artistic works (like a painting inside another painting) or commercial advertising campaigns or by activists or political campaigns, or in signs or any other kind of propaganda of collective movements, protests indoors or outdoors. The videos or any type of art works are non-political. Its only purpose is a long-time evolutionary purpose to ease human species evolution to excellence perfecting the morality of reason, but a reason based on evidence, tolerance, science, logic and nature’s beauty, and to present those art works in proper peaceful, civilized and refined contexts. As it was said, we resonate with nature’s beauty. This includes the deep original folklore of all ethnicities around the world who absorbs the beauty of natural patterns into their artistic traditions. We defend the individual freedom of choice and free markets without initiating brute force or deception to others. One more warning about “adapted material” and to be out of doubt. Creating an unproper visual, sound or music or any other kind of improper context will distort the original text message of the “license material” and will produce without doubt “adapted material”, something that is prohibited by this license, accordingly what it says in Section 1.a. of the CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NODERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC LICENSE. 
The third purpose for creating these videos for YouTube (or other art works) is to benefit the creators themselves. Indeed, it is an opportunity for the “licensees” to show their artistic talents to the world in a constructive cultural context. Through their videos in YouTube, they can show their unique professional talent and attract new potential clients to their businesses. It is also an opportunity to let their potential clients, who share their same values, that they are committed with the values of the King Neo New Renaissance Movement. WARNING: The “licensees” can copyright their videos as unique authors only if they fulfil the conditions of this license. In case they decide to apply to their videos a Creative Common license (or to any other type of creations), they must assure that the license they choose will not produce “adapted material” in the future, that is, that will not distort the original text of the 94 questions and answers and will continue advertising the game and book. Therefore, they must use this CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NODERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC LICENSE. In whatever case, “licensees”, in their creative works, are obliged to publish a notice that refers to this Public License accordingly what says in its Section 3 (a), (1), (A), (iii) (ii), and (iv). 
How to work with GitHub
One example on how to work with GitHub to create a video using the text of the questions and answers is as follows. For instance, they can start with the text of the questions and answers that is stored in the main branch of the repository. The text might be, for instance in json or word. A creator who wants to contribute to the movement can create another branch to make its changes. Or he can create a new fork. He can edit the text without changing it, that is, ha can present it in artistic ways without changing its meaning. He also can choose, for example, a one colour background. After he push its changes into his branch, a second contributor who is a photographer can make a new branch derived from this new branch and insert to the background some artistic photographs. A third contributor can make other branch from the main and create its own version of the text using 3D letters and, instead of using a flat background he can use a famous animations created in Blender as background. In this way, each branch will develop a production of a different video, in parallel, and will show the history of the production of each development for each video to explain in a better way the question and answer of one the 94 questions and answers.
King Neo Logo ©
Exceptional “licensees” who produce excellent works may be invited to enter the King Neo New Renaissance Movement Board Administrators. Those who accept are allow to use the King Neo © logo in their creations. 

Administrators
Administrators of the Board will maintain the GitHub page of the community, supervise the Code of Conduct, review the works of other “licensees” and will have preferences when some opportunities appear.

Code of conduct 
Introduction
The premise of this adult reasonable community is that nobody is here against its will. It is a good faith community of educated and good faith with resources individuals who are here with no ulterior purpose except to produce art. We understand art as beauty derived from nature’s order. Here we use art in regard to enhance and enrich the explanation of the “license material”. Everybody is free to join or leave the community as many times as it wishes. But anyone who violates the Code of Conduct will lose his reputation inside the community and will not be allowed to come back again. This Code of Conduct begins with the basic of following the law of the person’s country. This mean that people with criminal trials or charges, national or international, cannot join or stay in the community. Dishonest politicians, members with hidden agendas of NGO, or any other type of activists or members of organizations which their main objectives are against or may distort, distract or deviate the objectives of this community, they cannot be part or stay in this community. If they are part of any other community, public or secret, they must act in good faith to tell the truth when they sign the conditions to join this, at the moment when they fill the form to enter this community, a form where this kind of questions are asked. No member of this community can be in illegal conducts, such as the use of drugs or any other illegal activity. Although in this community we don’t discriminate gender, ethnicity or religion, this community is compound of high-educated moral persons of any race and in any country, but they all have a strong rational, secular and scientific approach to life, and with a great ambition to create art as beauty derived from nature’s order. Not everybody needs to agree with this view, but those who we do, we like to share with others like us to enrich our creations and expand the philosophical knowledge contained in the book and game. Because we believe man is a rational animal, we condemn the irrational as anti-human. Any irrational conduct is not tolerated. We respect the people who disagree with us and we request from them the same respect to disagree with their disagreement. This is not a place of debate of people who disagree with each other. That place exists in social media but is not the purpose of this community. The only purpose of this community is to integrate artistic images to the “license material” here provided by people who share our Aristotelian philosophic values. We don’t tolerate rational contradictions. We don’t tolerate the negation of the Law of Identity formulated by Aristotle that says A is A. Having said that, here is a list of the Code of Conduct members of the community. We start with the premise that everybody in the community agree with the values exposed in the book and the game, and that they act in good faith. (Abuse reports can be done in abuse@whatever.com. We will take your report seriously). People with contradictions or against the values of the community cannot enter or stay. What we do in this community is like doing a sport. If somebody don’t like this sport, he can find other in another place. Administrators of the community reserve the right to take whatever action they feel appropriate with regards to the Code of Conduct violations. What follows is a list of good conducts the members of the community must observe.

Good conducts

1.	Empathetic rational conversation. Be rational and understand that emotions derived from thoughts. Make people feel welcome, supported and never insult or discriminate. Behave as a well-educated aristocrat.
2.	Don’t be offended. If somebody disagree with you, breathe, be calm, carry on. Act rationally, ask why and perhaps you can learn something.
3.	No emotional hysteria. Be cool, calm and stylish. Put your rational Neocortex as the ruler of your Paleocortex. Control your chimp rate, as players do when they crown themselves playing the game. Count to 10 before acting. Postpone your opinion or sending an email or insult or saying something in bad faith that you may repent later. Just be patient and wait for 3 days before acting if you are in any kind of emotional irrational storm. Always act controlling your emotions and find the real causes of your exaggerated emotional reaction. Always ride the horse and don’t let the horse ride you. It doesn’t look good.
4.	We suggest to read the book and play the game as many times as possible, every month.
5.	Never initiate force or deception to others.
6.	Treat others as you expect they treat you.
7.	Judge but rationally and expect to be judged rationally.
8.	Don’t initiate conversations or debates beyond the purpose of the community that is no other than to add images to the text of the “license material”. There are other places for that.
9.	Try to see the rational genius and hero in others.
10.	We suggest to practice the morality of reason as it is explained in the book and its bibliography.
11.	Good faith premise. Accept a person you don’t know in good faith, who is not deliberately trying to deceit you, but report if he proves to act in bad faith.
12.	Listen without interruption in good faith, believing he is talking rationally and good faith. 
13.	Use language with words definitions as the 1960’s dictionaries say.
14.	 If you don’t understand something, identify what words are blur and ask your interlocutor definitions for them.
15.	Use precise concepts definitions attached to percepts. Ask for definitions and to what facts or evidence those words are attached.
16.	We don’t ask for people to apologize or feel guilty or to ask “emotional forgiveness”, but to rationally recognize the logic cause of an error to not repeat it again. 
17.	Secularism. We are guided by Aristotle’s ontology. We don’t believe that knowledge is inherent as Plato did, but is gradually acquired through our senses as Aristotle concluded. We seek truth through the scientific method. We believe in the primacy of existence over consciousness not vice-versa.
18.	Religious and political debates, hidden agendas or open activism is completely prohibited.
19.	Think big.
20.	We understand our ignorance about other cultures, so we practice tolerance and good mood without being quickly offended
21.	We respect all irrational cultural movements that don’t initiate force or deceit against others, like stopping the transit in cities, destroy sculptures, ban books, artists, sport competitors or make little children to doubt about their own physical characteristics.
22.	We don’t interfere with private intimate life between adults while they maintain it private. 

Evaluation system
Before publishing their artistic works, the “licensees” can show them to the administrators of the community to receive feedback, with the four categories of evaluation. Excellent, Good, Average and Unacceptable. As it was said, those who are “excellent exceptional” may be invited to join the King Neo New Renaissance Movement Board Administrators. 

Ranking of works
The GitHub community administrators will vote every three months for the best works of that period and produce a ranking that will be published in GitHub and the championsrenaissance website.

Templates and formats
Templates and formats apply not only to videos but to all type of creations. They all use the TEXT of the questions and answers. All these creations are divided in three parts. The first part (10% of the space or time) contains the advertising of the game and book (with a link where to buy them) and the advertising of the creators of the images with a link to their websites. The second part (the 80% of space or time) is the presentation of one question and one answer. The TEXT cannot be changed, but backgrounds and editing can. The third part (10% of the space or time) is the repetition of the opening advertising adding sponsors logos in case they exist.
