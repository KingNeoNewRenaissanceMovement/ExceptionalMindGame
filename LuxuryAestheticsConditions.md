### HIGH QUALITY AESTHETICS STANDARDS
This "luxury-aesthetics-conditions" is to be sure to produce high quality standards videos. The videos must be produced with luxury aesthetics requirements, similar to the aesthetics standards used in the luxury industry. The text used will be Cinzel and Cormorant fonts, black or white, or gold and silver colours, including light grey. Dark purple, black and white backgrounds too, in a similar style of the championsrenaissance website and the game aesthetics. (Download the free demo version of the philosophical-quiz-game to see its aesthetics here https://championsrenaissance.com/shop/). Our aesthetics references are similar to the luxury aesthetic standards used by high quality companies such as Rolls-Royce or Rolex. We suggest to see their advertising, pictures and websites as a guide to inspire you. 

### HISTORIC AESTETHICS REFERENCES
Our aesthetics references is the art of the Renaissance, especially the works of Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci and Botticelli, and also the works of Ancient Athens such as the Parthenon. 

The Oscar winners of Animated-Short-Films are also our aesthetic reference. (Here they are some YouTube examples like Father And Daughter 2000 Oscar Winning; or Umbrella; Badgered by Sharon Colman; Funny Animation by IJustAm, CGI 3D Animated Short; “The Albatross” by Joel Best, Alex Jeremy, and Alex Karonis; Migrants Award-Winning and “Ascension” by Ascension le Film; Disney Pixar “Piper” – Music by lewisjackmusic; Oh Sheep! by Filmbilder & Friends; Man Animated Short Film; Fox And The Whale, among others). 

### MUSIC AND SOUNDS
The music aesthetics references to create the videos are similar to Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Rachmaninov and the like; modern slow electronic and fashion show music or light jazz, but not sad music. They must be happy, that is, allegro or andante. Discotheque music, heavy metal, hard rock, reggaeton and the like are not allowed. Any type of songs with text, choirs or soloists, including opera is not allowed to avoide confusion. The sounds used also must enhance the understanding of the questions and answers, therefore, sounds and music cannot be out of context. We prefere natural sounds, waves at the beach, rain, etc. The golden number and Fibonacci sequence are welcomed in music, sounds and visual designs as well.

### ART DEFINITION
We understand art as the beauty derived from nature’s order, but not just to represent it or imitate it. We encourage to create art works derived from natural patterns, abstract or not, that may include natural landscapes like mountains, stars, clouds, waves and sea. We understand art as Aristotle did, a form of expression that has the potential to be appreciated for its beauty and creativity, but not only as a replication of nature, but to pursue a higher ideal of beauty, truth, and morality. In Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle says: “A virtuous person takes pleasure in other people actions that express moral virtues, and is upset by actions caused by moral vices, just as a musician enjoys beautiful songs but finds bad ones painful”. (NE IX 9.1170a8–11)

### ARISTOTLE AND AYN RAND ART'S VIEW
Aristotle’s idea of art has been influential for centuries, and it continues to shape the way we think about art today. Aristotle's view of art shows man as it could be and should be, that is, the best version of himself, its own hero, such as Achilles of the Iliad. We view art as beauty. For us, beauty is in nature's order, not in pseudo-art derived from political propaganda or engineered cultural movements.

We also share Ayn Rand view of art. She is an intellectual descendant of Aristotle. We share what she expressed in her book "The Romantic Manifesto: A Philosophy of Literature". Also, in another book called "What Art Is: The Esthetic Theory of Ayn Rand".

In the Ayn Rand Lexicon she says: “Art is a concretization of metaphysics. Art brings man’s concepts to the perceptual level of his consciousness and allows him to grasp them directly, as if they were percepts.” We view art as a kind of special-mind-wine of aesthetic-pleasure for the human soul, to propel him to become the champion of himself, to become its own hero, the become the optimal rational-animal he can be, the man who pursues its eudaimonia. Iliad by Homer, and Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, are our main literature aesthetics references in novels.
